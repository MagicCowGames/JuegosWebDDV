// If you need more than one type of trigger, you can either have 2 separate gameobjects or have them attached to the same
// gameobject with more than one trigger component.

// NOTE : For now, only the player can trigger these. We will make this configurable in the future by adding entity controller scripts which will be gotten on trigger
// and used to determine what type of entity has collided with the trigger.
